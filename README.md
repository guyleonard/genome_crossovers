# Genome Crossovers

Just a bit of fun to keep track of which genomes (in this case genomes with a set of predicted proteins) are available where.

I am mainly taking information from NCBI, Ensembl, JGI, EuPathDB portals (and their consituent portals e.g Mycocosm etc) as of ~April 2018. Occasionally I add in other genomes not available from these 'main' portals to cover my own needs.
I am only really interested in keeping track of the Eukaryotes (for another project OrcharDB). I have also split them into 4 rough 'groups', with that said I am not making any specific comment on these groupings, it's just a little easier to keep track of them this way.

## Fungi
The total number of genomes from each of the 'big' genome portals are as below:

Ensembl|JGI|FungiDB|Other|NCBI
-------|---|-------|-----|----
761|874|81|25|900

### Upset Plot
Their intersections are as below, this is like a Venn diagram but 1000x better:

For example, we can see that:

 * whilst NCBI contains the most genomes, only 91 are unique
 * whereas JGI has the most number of unique genomes at 531 not available elsewhere
 * the 4 genome portals share 39 of the same genomes
 * with Ensembl and NCBI having the largest overlap

## Plants

## Metazoa

## Protists / Other
