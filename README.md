# Genome Crossovers

Just a bit of fun to keep track of which genomes (in this case genomes with a set of predicted proteins) are available where.

I am mainly taking information from NCBI, Ensembl, JGI, EuPathDB as of May 2018. Occasionally I add in other genomes not available from these 'main' portals to cover my own needs.

## Fungi

## Plants

## Metazoa

## Protists / Other
