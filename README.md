# Genome Crossovers

Just a bit of fun to keep track of which genomes (in this case genomes with a set of predicted proteins) are available where.

I am mainly taking information from NCBI, Ensembl, JGI, EuPathDB portals (and their consituent portals e.g Mycocosm etc) as of ~April 2018. Occasionally I add in other genomes not available from these 'main' portals to cover my own needs.
I am only really interested in keeping track of the Eukaryotes (for another project OrcharDB). I have also split them into 4 rough 'groups', with that said I am not making any specific comment on these groupings, it's just a little easier to keep track of them this way.

## Fungi

The total number of genomes from each of the 'big' genome portals are as below:
Ensembl|JGI|FungiDB|Other|NCBI
-------|---|-------|-----|----
761|874|81|25|900



## Plants

## Metazoa

## Protists / Other
